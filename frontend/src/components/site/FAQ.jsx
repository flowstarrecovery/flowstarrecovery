  {
    q: "What exactly are surplus funds?",
    a: "When a property is sold at foreclosure or tax sale for more than what was owed, the leftover proceeds — after debts and fees — are surplus funds. Those dollars belong to the former owner, heirs, or junior lien-holders depending on state law.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Flowstar charge?",
    a: "We work strictly on contingency. There are no upfront fees, no retainers, and no out-of-pocket filing costs. Our fee is a pre-agreed percentage of the recovered funds and is only collected if we succeed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does the recovery process take?",
    a: "Timelines vary significantly by state, case type, and complexity. Straightforward claims can move quickly; matters involving probate, multiple lien-holders, or contested ownership typically take longer. We provide a realistic, case-specific timeline after our initial review.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to live in the same state as the property?",
    a: "No. We operate in all 50 states and handle claims regardless of where you currently live. Documents can be signed and notarized remotely in most jurisdictions.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if the former owner has passed away?",
    a: "Surplus funds can typically be recovered by heirs through probate or affidavit procedures. We routinely handle estate-based claims and coordinate with executors and family members.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are you attorneys?",
    a: "Flowstar Asset Recovery is an asset recovery firm, not a law firm. We do not provide legal advice. For complex matters that require litigation, we partner with licensed attorneys in the relevant jurisdiction.",
  },
